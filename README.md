# To Do List

This project is a fairly basic to-do list app built in React. It was bootstraped using create-react-app. Tasks are stored between sessions using LocalStorage and can be added, edited, and deleted. Data is managed between components via the use of the useState hook. Unique IDs are generated for each task using UUID. 

A live version of this app can be seen at http://bhsimon97.github.io/to-do-list
